The Docker file:
Sure, here's a line-by-line explanation of your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use Ubuntu 24.04 as the base image
FROM ubuntu:24.04
```
This line is pulling the `ubuntu` Docker image with the tag `24.04` from Docker Hub.

```Dockerfile
# Set the environment variable to noninteractive mode
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
```
This line is setting the `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` environment variable to `noninteractive`. This is often done in Dockerfiles to prevent interactive prompts from appearing during the build process.

```Dockerfile
# Set /app as the working directory
WORKDIR /app
```
This line is setting the working directory inside the Docker container to `/app`. All subsequent `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` commands will be run relative to this directory.

```Dockerfile
# Copy the shell script and the .env file into the Docker image
COPY auth_script.sh .
COPY .env .
```
These lines are copying the `auth_script.sh` and `.env` files from your local machine (the Docker build context) to the current directory (`/app`) inside the Docker container.

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update &&  \
    # Install required dependencies
    apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    python3-venv \
    gnupg \
    git \
    curl \
    wget \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    # Download Modular setup requirements
    && set -eux; \
    keyring_location=/usr/share/keyrings/modular-installer-archive-keyring.gpg \
    && curl -1sLf 'https://dl.modular.com/bBNWiLZX5igwHXeu/installer/gpg.0E4925737A3895AD.key' | gpg --dearmor >> ${keyring_location} \
    && curl -1sLf 'https://dl.modular.com/bBNWiLZX5igwHXeu/installer/config.deb.txt?distro=debian&codename=wheezy' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/modular-installer.list \
    && apt-get update \
    # Install Modular
    && apt-get install -y modular \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && echo 'export MODULAR_HOME="/root/.modular"' >> ~/.bashrc \
    && echo 'export PATH="/root/.modular/pkg/packages.modular.com_mojo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc \
    && /bin/bash -c "source ~/.bashrc" \
    # Install Mojo Lang
    && modular clean \
    && chmod +x auth_script.sh \
    && ./auth_script.sh \
    && modular install mojo \
    # Create a symbolic link that points from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3
    && ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python \
    # Clean unrequired dependencies
    && apt-get remove -y \
    gnupg \
    && apt-get autoremove -y \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* \
    && apt-get purge -y --auto-remove \
    # Delete the files after you're done with them
    && rm auth_script.sh .env
```
This `RUN` command is doing a lot of things. It's updating the package lists, installing some packages, cleaning up, downloading and installing Modular and Mojo Lang, creating a symbolic link for Python, and cleaning up again, all had been run
in a single RUN command to reduce the number of docker layers, and then reducing the docker image size

```Dockerfile
# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80
```
This line is telling Docker that the Docker container will listen on port 80. This doesn't actually publish the port; it's more like documentation. To publish the port, you need to use the `-p` option with `docker run`.

```Dockerfile
# Set the entrypoint and command to keep the container running
ENTRYPOINT ["tail"]
CMD ["-f", "/dev/null"]
```
These lines are setting the default command that will be executed when the Docker container is run. In this case, the `tail -f /dev/null` command will be run, which does nothing and never exits. This is often used in Dockerfiles to keep the Docker container running indefinitely.

The Docker compose file:

Sure, here's a line-by-line explanation of your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
```
This line specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. This should match the version of Docker Compose you are using.

```yaml
services:
```
This line begins the section where you define your services. Each service represents a container that will be run when you start your Docker Compose application.

```yaml
  mojo-sdk:
```
This line begins the definition of a service named `mojo-sdk`.

```yaml
    container_name: mojo-sdk
```
This line sets the name of the container when it is run. If you don't specify this, Docker Compose will generate a name based on the project and service names.

```yaml
    image: mojo-sdk:r0.6
```
This line specifies the Docker image to use for this service. In this case, it's using the `mojo-sdk` image with the tag `r0.6`.

```yaml
    build:
```
This line begins a section where you can specify build options. These options will be used if you need to build the Docker image for this service.

```yaml
      context: .
```
This line sets the build context to the current directory. The build context is the set of files that Docker can access during the build process.

```yaml
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.mojosdk
```
This line specifies the name of the Dockerfile to use when building the Docker image. In this case, it's using `Dockerfile.mojosdk`.

```yaml
      no_cache : true
```
This line tells Docker not to use the build cache when building the Docker image.

```yaml
    volumes:
```
This line begins a section where you can specify volumes to mount in the container.

```yaml
      - /home/hajsf/Development/mojo:/root
```
This line mounts the `/home/hajsf/Development/mojo` directory from the host machine to the `/root` directory in the container.

```yaml
      - mojo:/root
```
This line mounts the `mojo` volume to the `/root` directory in the container.

```yaml
    ports:
```
This line begins a section where you can specify ports to expose from the container.

```yaml
      - 3000:80
```
This line maps port 3000 on the host machine to port 80 in the container.

```yaml
volumes:
```
This line begins a section where you can define named volumes. Named volumes can be used by multiple services and persist data even when no containers are using them.

```yaml
  mojo:
```
This line defines a named volume called `mojo`.
